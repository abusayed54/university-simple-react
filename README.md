# Welcome To My University Detail Show Project

=> This Project created with React js.
=> First, I collected data from google with Top 21 Universities in Bangladesh.
=> Second, I convert my custom object to JSON file.
=> Third, Then I set data to my react public file and load from there.
=> When I am loading my data I use fetch() function
